To do:
* add custom form validation (boostrap styling?)
* Create a collasable menu in the bottom (?) right, where you can click to open a side (bottom?) menu
* When the user clicks that icon, give them multiple "skin" styling options
  * These options could include:
    1. Bootstrap UI (default theme)
    2. Bootstap (or w/e) UI using google, amazon, wiki, etc.
    3. Materlize UI (my design)
    4. 

Optional:
* Make the results appear in several columns, formatted to appear like high scores in a video game.
* Have the scores appear with a second delay (jquery effects?) to simulate the high score displays
* Make an arcade game "skin" for this, or allow the user to choose their favorite "skin"

Ideas:
* Is there a way to do the "beep beep" sound from the old games, when the 'scores' load? 
* How to make a blinking cursor in the input box?
* How to make a smooth scroll like game credits
* How to make the things appear one at a time, in slow mo.
