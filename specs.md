## Beep Boop
Create a web application that takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:

Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Beep!"
Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "Boop!"
Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced (all digits) with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
These exceptions are written from least to most important. The first exception should apply unless the second exception does, and the same with the second and third. So, for example, in your finished program,

The number 13 should be replaced with "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."
The number 21 should be replaced with "Boop".
The number 32 should be replaced with "(Insert brogrammer movie quote here)."
A user should be able to enter a new number and see new results over and over again.

Example: If a user inputs a 5, the program should display a list of values: "0", "Beep!", "Boop", "I'm Sorry...", 4, 5





To do:
* add custom form validation (boostrap styling?)
* Create a collasable menu in the bottom (?) right, where you can click to open a side (bottom?) menu
* When the user clicks that icon, give them multiple "skin" styling options
  * These options could include:
    1. Bootstrap UI (default theme)
    2. Bootstap (or w/e) UI using google, amazon, wiki, etc.
    3. Materlize UI (my design)
    4. 

Optional:
* Make the results appear in several columns, formatted to appear like high scores in a video game.
* Have the scores appear with a second delay (jquery effects?) to simulate the high score displays
* Make an arcade game "skin" for this, or allow the user to choose their favorite "skin"

Ideas:
* Is there a way to do the "beep beep" sound from the old games, when the 'scores' load? 
* How to make a blinking cursor in the input box?
* How to make a smooth scroll like game credits
* How to make the things appear one at a time, in slow mo.
